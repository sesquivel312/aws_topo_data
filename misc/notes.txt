Items to be added to topo discovery:
* cgw (customer gateway) (vgw is already included)
* vpn = cgw <> vpngw
* vpce = endpoint (e.g. to S3) x

Misc:
-----
Nat Instances
* can be the target of a route
* is a "regular" instance (though there are purpose built images for it - via community marketplace - search for amzn-ami-vpc-nat - or maybe just nat)
* AWS recognizes an instance as a "nat instance" when it's src/dst check is disabled (enabled by default
* can query via the boto3.instance.source_dest_check attribute, which is a boolean

Endpoints
* are "back end" routes to an AWS service (currently only supported by S3 for IPV4), prevents using Internet as transit path
*  Are added in VPC config
* have an associated prefix-list -- maintained by AWS and contains the public IP blocks for the service
* routes are created in the designated route table(s) when you create the endpoint
  NB: CANNOT create routes using endpoints manually
