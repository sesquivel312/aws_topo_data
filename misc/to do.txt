Just done: parsing rules by subnet (well almost done, needs some clean up ...)

Next: code checks against the rules by subnet.  Print out a report something like:
subnet id: xxxx
rule allows access from anywhere <subnet/host/sgid>
rule allows access from large address range <subnet/host/sgid>
rule allows access on a wide range of ports <subnet/host/sgid>
rule allows access to a high risk port <subnet/host/sgid>

Notes on above:
*** I likely will need to add additional code b/c I believe I've lost the subnet/host/sgid info in my rule parsing :(
* Will need to check if any of the high risk ports are in a port range
* will need to determine how to handle multiple issues/rule - i.e. 1 rule allows from anywhere for a large port range that happens to include high risk ports
    * ideally will have a single output line for a rule indicating all the rule violations, rather than multiple output lines for a single rule
* Will need to address rules that use a security group as a src - i.e. look that up - probably need to build a sg:CIDR map (figure out how this works I believe this means there could be multiple IP ranges / SG as the SGs are applied to hosts, not subnets


rules
----
src || dst == any
src || dst == "large" block (large is a variable)
port = "large" range (large is a variable)
port == "high risk" port

Futures:

Network ACL's
Internet networks (i.e. over VPNs)
Handling Tiers > this will require tagging standards
