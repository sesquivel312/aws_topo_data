* Report for rule checks (in addition to logging)
* fix logging to handle multiple output thresholds (e.g. warning, info, etc.)
* handling ICMP protocol in checks (and elsewhere?)
* handling SG's and other (?) things in the src/dest spot of a rule
* add check for rule allows access from anywhere <subnet/host/sgid> << think about this a bit
* determine how to handle nodes that are in a state other than "in use", e.g. deleted - do we weant them in the DB or not, if they are we should render them differently and include a note when "rendering" to text - look at using some sort of data structure that returns a bunch of 2-tuples of networkx-node-lists & pyplot attributes for rendering those nodes
