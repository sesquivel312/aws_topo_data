* create function to map account #'s to names and vice versa
    * use key names of the form ew_awskey_<account_short_name>_(id|key) in OS environment
    * use the <account_short_name> to extract the account names from the cred environment variable names
    * use the API to get the corresponding account #'s - set the keys as needed from the data just collected and populate a dict
    * run over the dict just created and add the reverse mapping (acct# to name)

* fix vpn edge handling - may only be missing b/c VPN is down
* handling SG's and other (?) things in the src/dest spot of a rule
* fix logging to handle multiple output thresholds (e.g. warning, info, etc.)
* add check for rule allows access from anywhere <subnet/host/sgid> << think about this a bit
* determine how to handle nodes that are in a state other than "in use", e.g. deleted - do we weant them in the DB or not, if they are we should render them differently and include a note when "rendering" to text - look at using some sort of data structure that returns a bunch of 2-tuples of networkx-node-lists & pyplot attributes for rendering those nodes
